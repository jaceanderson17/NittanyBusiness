This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

When starting the app always make sure to run "npm i" in the terminal

Setting Up DB:

1. Download MySQL and MySQL Workbench and create a local instance.
2. Create a schema for NittanyBusiness
3. Add the relevant data and tables provided on Canvas
4. Create a .env file on your local development environment and add the following infomation which will be unique for each of us:
   (.env is in gitignore so do not worry about commiting it)
   DB_HOST=localhost (don't change)
   DB_PORT=3306 (don't change)
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=your_database

   Ex:
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=12345
   DB_NAME=NittanyBusiness (name of the schema you've created)
